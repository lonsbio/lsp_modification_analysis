# LSP Modification Analysis

## Docker

Contents of `secretomep-1.0` and `sub_programs` are incomplete. Due to the licenses these programs are under, installation need to be performed manually and each program downloaded and placed in the correct location.

## Modifictions

Functions to modify sequences based on SignalP output are included in `protein_variation_functions.py`. A command line wrapper to process sequence files with these functions is in `modify_sequence.py`. Requires `signalp` to be installed.
